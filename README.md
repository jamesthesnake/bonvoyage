## What is `bonvoyage`?  ???

Transform percentage-based units into a 2d space to evaluate changes in distribution with both magnitude and direction.

## Installation

To install `anchor`, we recommend using the
[Anaconda Python Distribution](http://anaconda.org/) and creating an
environment, so the `anchor` code and dependencies don't interfere with
anything else. Here is the command to create an environment:

```
conda create -n anchor-env pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### Stable (recommended)

To install this code from the Python Package Index, you can install on the
command line via `pip`:

```
pip install bonvoyage
```

### Bleeding-edge (for the brave)

To install this code, clone this github repository and use `pip` to install

    git clone git@github.com:yeolab/bonvoyage
    cd bonvoyage
    pip install .  # The "." means "install *this*, the folder where I am now"


## Usage


To use `bonvoyage` to get waypoints, you want your `data` to be a `pandas`
DataFrame of shape (n_samples, n_features)

```python
import bonvoyage

wp = bonvoyage.Waypoints()
waypoints = wp.fit_transform(data)
```

`bonvoyage` is modeled after `scikit-learn` in is method of creating a
transforming object and then running `fit_transform()` to perform the computation.

To plot the waypoints, use a `waypointplot`, which can do either `"scatter"` or
`"hex"` plot types. By default, `hexbin` plots are used:


```python
import bonvoyage

bonvoyage.waypointplot(waypoints)
```

You can also specify to use `scatter`:

```python
import bonvoyage

bonvoyage.waypointplot(waypoints, kind='scatter')
```

To add color, give a series or other `groupby`-able object:

```python
import bonvoyage

bonvoyage.waypointplot(waypoints, kind='scatter', features_groupby=modalities)
```
